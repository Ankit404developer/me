        <h1>Smart Vehicle 2.0</h1>
        <p>A fully connected vehicle that uses IoT and AI to monitor health, improve fuel efficiency, and optimize
            travel routes.</p>

            <h2>Health Monitoring</h2>
            <p>The vehicle continuously monitors the driver's health using wearable devices and in-car sensors. It
                checks the drivers heart rate SpO2 rate and if they are abnormal then sends warning to the driver. It
                continously checks the drivers drowsiness and if drowsiness is detected immediately sends an alert via
                Blynk. It also works at the time when accident happens. It sends the location of the car, a sms and a
                call to the meber via an app developed by me.</p>

            <h2>Fuel Efficiency</h2>
            <p>Advanced algorithms optimize fuel consumption based on driving patterns and real-time traffic data. There
                is a specific technology which helps to find the shortest road by gps between two places. This Helps us
                to save much ammount fuel or electriciy and time.</p>

        <div class="feature" id="feature3">
            <h2>Route Optimization</h2>
            <p>The system suggests the most efficient routes using AI and real-time traffic updates.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Health data is collected from wearable devices and in-car sensors.</li>
            <li>Fuel consumption is optimized using advanced algorithms.</li>
            <li>Routes are suggested based on real-time traffic data and AI analysis.</li>
